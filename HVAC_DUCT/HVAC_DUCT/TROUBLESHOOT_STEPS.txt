HVAC_DUCT TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS
===============================

STATUS: DLL compiled successfully with 1 warning (architecture mismatch)
WARNING: Processor architecture mismatch (MSIL vs AMD64) - this might be the issue!

STEP 1: Test Basic DLL Loading
==============================
1. Open AutoCAD Architecture
2. Type: APPLOAD
3. Browse to: D:\PROJECT_API_CAD\MECH\HVAC_DUCT\HVAC_DUCT\HVAC_DUCT\
4. Select: HVAC_Minimal.lsp
5. Click: Load
6. Check the message in command line

Expected: "SUCCESS: HVAC_DUCT.dll loaded!"
If FAILED: The DLL has a compatibility issue

STEP 2: If Step 1 FAILS - Fix Architecture Issue
================================================
The warning shows: "processor architecture of the project being built 'MSIL' and the processor architecture of the reference 'AMD64'"

SOLUTION A: Change Project Architecture
1. Open HVAC_DUCT.csproj in Visual Studio
2. Right-click project → Properties
3. Build → Platform target: Change from "Any CPU" to "x64"
4. Rebuild project
5. Test again

SOLUTION B: Use 32-bit AutoCAD
1. Check if you're using 64-bit AutoCAD
2. Try with 32-bit AutoCAD if available
3. Or rebuild for 32-bit (x86)

STEP 3: If Step 1 SUCCESS - Test Commands
=========================================
1. Type: REGISTERERASE
2. Type: AUTO
3. Check if commands work

STEP 4: If Commands Work - Test Ticks
=====================================
1. Draw a polyline
2. Type: TANDUCTGOOD
3. Check if ticks appear

STEP 5: If Still Not Working - Alternative Approach
==================================================
1. Try loading DLL directly:
   - Type: APPLOAD
   - Browse to: D:\PROJECT_API_CAD\MECH\HVAC_DUCT\HVAC_DUCT\HVAC_DUCT\bin\Debug\
   - Select: HVAC_DUCT.dll
   - Click: Load

2. If that works, the issue is with LISP loading
3. If that fails, the issue is with the DLL itself

FILES TO TEST
=============
1. HVAC_Minimal.lsp - Basic DLL load test
2. HVAC_Test_Basic.lsp - Comprehensive testing
3. HVAC_DUCT.dll - The actual DLL file

MOST LIKELY ISSUE
=================
The processor architecture mismatch warning suggests the DLL was built for 32-bit but AutoCAD is 64-bit (or vice versa).

QUICK FIX
=========
1. Open project in Visual Studio
2. Change Platform Target to x64
3. Rebuild
4. Test again

REPORT BACK
===========
Please try Step 1 and tell me:
1. What message you see (SUCCESS or FAILED)
2. Any error messages
3. Your AutoCAD version (32-bit or 64-bit)
